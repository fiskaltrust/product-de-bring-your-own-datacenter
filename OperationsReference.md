## Reset Cashbox via Echo Endpoint
Since several Cashboxes are hosted in one BackendPOD, there could be the requirement to restart only one particular Cashbox (f.i. to reload its config). To do so, the Echo Endpoint can be triggered.
```sh
/api/Echo

Body:
{
    "message": ""
}
```
By passing CashboxID and Accesstoken, the Cashbox does a immedeate reset and reload its config from helipad.fiskaltrust.cloud.

See our [Postmancollection](https://github.com/fiskaltrust/product-de-bring-your-own-datacenter/blob/master/fiskaltrust%20DE%20ByoDC%20TestCall.postman_collection.json) for an example call:

This Endpoint can also be triggered several times sequential (e.g. in a bulk update scenario)

### Restart of all Cashboxes
In a massive update scenario (all or the vast majority of cashboxes were rebuilded) it is possible to restart all BackendPODs by triggering a rolling restart. K8S will send the SIGTERM Signal to the affected POD so current requests should be completed properly.

Example:
```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=bring-your-own-datacenter 
kubectl get deployments 
kubectl rollout restart deployment byodc
```


## LogFiles
fiskaltrust Middleware in ByoDC does not support local Logfiles.  
Usual logging practice in K8S environments is to handle logs via stdout/stderr.

## Replace Emmisary-ingress (Abassador) Loadbalancer
Emissary-ingress PODs are the default Loadbalancers for ByoDC. There is an important reason for that. For Backend PODs to work properly, it is essential that every cashbox is a singleton on the whole ByoDC cluster.  
So we use _Header based Routing_ by the CashBoxId. If a cashbox is already existing on a BackendPOD, the load balancer routes this request always to the same BackendPOD (like a sticky session). If this Cashbox is not existing it will be created and gains a Redis Lock. In this case the cashbox loads its config from helipad, this may take some time.

**Attention:** Keep in mind, if you replace the Emissary-ingress PODs by another solution, that this behaviour is exact the same. Otherwise you may encounter unexpected timeouts and performance issues!

## Supported Rollout Scenarios
In Contrast to the local installed middleware (ft-launcher), ByoDC supports only scenarios where each cashbox contains exact 1 Queue and 1 SCU.
Figuratively, those parts of our rollout scenarios are included:
- https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/posdealers/rollout-doc/middleware#a-cloud-tse-for-multiple-cash-registers
  <br>Keep in mind that you may use the SCU, which was created by Portal Checkout, for all Cashboxes (per Outlet). If templates were used, simply reference the SCU.<br>
Endpoints should look like:<br>
    - Queue: rest://localhost:1500/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
    - SCU: grpc://localhost:XXXX
- https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/posdealers/rollout-doc/middleware#rollout-scenario-with-terminals  
 
All other documented scenarios are not applicable to ByoDC deployments.

## Update of Cashboxes to newer Software Version
fiskaltrust Middleware is constantly improving. Usually several days after a Middleware Release, ByoDC BackendPOD Container Image will be updated (also the HELM Chart if needed).  

### Get current ByoDC BackendPOD Version

You can call the `/api/version` endpoint on a BackendPOD to get the running Middleware version. 

### Update Deployment

To Update your ByoDC Environment, take the following steps:
1. Helm Chart was updated  
  Update your repo to get the actual charts:
  `helm repo update`  
  Upgrade your deployment:  
  `helm upgrade bring-your-own-datcenter fiskaltrust/bring-your-own-datacenter -f config.yaml -n bring-your-own-datacenter`  
  be aware that the variables may differ to your deployment

2. BackendPOD Image was updated  
  Restarting the deployment from our chart will pull the latest ByoDC BackendPOD Image with a compatible minor version:
  `kubectl rollout restart deployment/byodc -n bring-your-own-datacenter`  
  be aware that the variables may differ to your deployment  
  > ***Note:** You can override this by setting the [`byodc.image.tag` Parameter](./ParameterReference.md#section-byodc) in your `config.yaml` to a specific version (e.g. `1.3.29-buster`).

3. Update Cashbox Versions in ft-portal *(Optional)*  
  To align the used Software Version to ft-Portal Configuration, our Update Wizard may be used: [Portal Configuration Update Site](https://portal.fiskaltrust.de/UpdateConfiguration)  
  A Description for Bulk updating Cashboxes can be found [here](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/docs/posdealers/rollout-doc/how-to/bulk-update-cashboxes) ("Restart the fiskaltrust.Middleware" section can be ignored)
